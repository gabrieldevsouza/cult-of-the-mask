Elisa: Please, stop cursing me with your magic that makes me hated and despised by everyone.
Elisa: I can't believe this is happening. I don't want this.
Masked: You have to kill me. There's no turning back.
Elisa: I don't want to be hated anymore. I don't wish to be scorned by everyone anymore.
Masked: You have no choice.
Elisa: Go to hell!
