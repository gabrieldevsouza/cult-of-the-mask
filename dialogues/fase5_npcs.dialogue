Everyone is scared when they see me.
No one comes to talk to me anymore.
I don't feel the power and magnificence that was promised to me.

The child screams when she sees me. Frightened, she runs away from me.
I miss the warmth of her presence.

The square is silent, funereal.
Where are my worshippers?
